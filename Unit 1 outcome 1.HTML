            My name is Adam and I am an IT consultant. I have recently set up my own IT consultancy. I have a great interest in technology as I believe it can make life easier for everyone. Below are my thoughts on some areas regarding IT.

        <h2>The Purpose Of IT in Modern Business</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="post">
        <p>
        In this modern world having a good IT infrastructure is essential for and business of any size. 
        This includes having devices that are suitable and staff who know how to use them, even if your business only has one computer.
        </p>
        <p>
        IT can take a repetitive and or time consuming task historically done by a human and do it over and over for accurate and consistent results, without tiring.
        </p>
        <p>
        One way IT can save time for a business is by using a spreadsheet software to monitor cash flow and automatically work out VAT increases on products or services provided.
        You would need to set up a spreadsheet with the correct formulas in, but once this is done it can be used over and over again, thus saving time, not having to do it by hand.
        </p>
        <p>
        The majority of people have access to the internet these days and are able to access it anywhere thanks to smartphones and tablets. So if your business does not have a website then you are severely limiting the potential customers you can reach.
        </p>
        <p>
        IT can also allow customers to access your products and services without any human interaction, such as ordering products online. A customer can go to your website order something, have it delivered next day and never have any communication with someone who works for your company. This can save money by employing less staff and time because it could mean the staff you do have can work on other things.
        </p>
        <p>
        The main things to consider are IT can save time, money and increase your exposure to potential customers from all around the world.

        <h2>Describe Methods, Skills And Resources Needed To Complete Digital Successfully</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="post">
        <p>
        There are several types of project management methods available. One is the waterfall methodology. This is a sequential idea that is heavily based on the requirement outcomes. You must have an idea of the what is expected before you can start as the scope cannot be changed once you have started. It is divided into stages which can be called; requirement, analysis, design, implement, testing, deployment and maintenance, each stage must be complete before you can move on to the next. This is easy to use but has a higher risk of failure due to errors often requiring the project to be started over.
        </p>
        <p>    
        You could have an agile method, this allow more flexibility and has a lower risk of failure, but is required to have more collection between the stakeholders which can delay things. An agile method is the opposite of a waterfall method.
        </p>
        <p>
        You can also have a hybrid method, which combines the best features of both the waterfall style and the agile style. This gives you increased flexibility but requires a compromise as you are trying to coordinate to opposite ends of a spectrum.
        </p>
        <p>
        There are many skills that could be needed to successful run a digital project.
        </p>
        <p>
        To start with basic computer skills, like knowing how to turn a computer on and off safely would be essential for all staff using computers. Beyond that, staff that work in accounting could need skills on how to write spreadsheet formulas so they can work out profit of tax.
        </p>
        <p>
        Marketing teams might need skills in how to use software like Microsoft Publisher, so they can create effective marketing materials like leaflets or posters.
        </p>
        <p>
        Probably most important in the modern world is staff that have skills in social media, like someone to manage a Twitter or Facebook page, many people use social media to get reviews on companies, and social media can be used to reach out to more potential customers, this could be done trough the use of adverts on a site like Facebook.
        </p>
        <p>
        The most obvious resources needed would be the devices capable of accessing the internet and where you can create and manage your own website and social media accounts.
        </p>
        <p>
        A desktop PC or laptop would be a common idea, though many people are turning to tablets as they are highly portable. It would depend on the nature of business as to what device would be best for you, if you were office based then a desktop PC would probably be best, and if your role required you to be travelling and meeting people then something more portable like a tablet would be more better.
        </p>
        <p>   
        Your computer will probably need certain peripherals, like a keyboard and mouse for inputting data or commands, and a monitor or printer to get an output. You might have a touchscreen monitor which is both and input and output device.
        </p>
        <p>    
        As mentioned before you need the right staff, staff who can operate computer safely and staff who have more specific skills like spreadsheet skills, or website design.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="head"> 
        <h2>Plan and carry out tasks using IT</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="post">
        <p>
        One way to use IT to plan out tasks is to use an online system like Trello. Trello allows you to create things called cards where you can write a task on and monitor its progress. Once a task is complete you can move it to a new section so you always know what stage your work is at. Click <a href="https://trello.com/b/8r7Nk0RZ/code-nation-unit-1">here</a> to go to my Trello page. You could break down the task of building a website into smaller tasks like, type text for homepage where we introduce our services. Or another task like, get data for statistics page, (to show how much money we can save our customers).
        </p>
        <p>   
        You could use other software like Microsoft Viso, which allows you to create flow charts and mind maps.
        </p>
        <p>   
        Or you could a spreadsheet software, this will give you great customisation but it is not explicitly designed for monitoring tasks like Trello.
    </div>
    <div class="head">    
        <h2>Describe The Risks That Might Impact Digital Projects</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="post">    
        <p>
        There are many risks that could impact upon digital projects, risks are a reality and can cause projects to go over time and budget.
        </p>
        <p>   
        One example of something that could go wrong; say you are in the middle of 12 month project to build a new website. 9 months in Apple could release a new iOS version meaning that all the work done over the last 9 months wouldn't work properly on this new iOS.
        </p>
        <p>   
        Another risk could be cyber attack, It is likely that you will have data stored on your customers which you have a legal obligation to protect. Hackers could attempt to access this data and sell it on. So a robust security system is needed. This could also help prevent virus's.
        </p>
        <p>   
        One last example of something that could go wrong is a key project members leaves the project mid way through, this would leave a potential gap in knowledge and skills. So it is important to have a system in place where staff can keep trace of what they have done so new staff can pick up where the older staff left off.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="head">    
        <h2>Describe How You Would Go About Selecting And Using IT Systems And Software</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="post">
        <p>
        Choosing what software and system to use can be tricky, but it doesn't need to be. It all depends on the size and nature of your business.
        </p>
        <p>   
        One example could be regarding accounting software. Mr Smith a plumber who is a sole trader will probably be fine doing his accounts on a spreadsheet, as he no staff to pay manages all the sales and purchase himself. A small or medium enterprise (SME) might be better off using an off the shelf accounting software like Sage, which staff can be trained in. As for a large international company like Mc'Donald they would probably benefit from a bespoke accounting software.
        </p>
        <p>   
        Another example could be that of choosing a portable device like a tablet or laptop over a desktop PC if your business requires staff to be travelling around a lot. You might need to consider giving some of your staff smart phones, so they can communicate on the go as it will give them access to email and social media.
        <p>
        </p>
        One final example could be that Windows of Mac. Again this would depends of the type of business you are in and personal preference. Windows are more common place and cheaper but Macs are preferable for those doing coding or software development, but cost more.
        </p>

    </div>
    <div class="post">
        <p>
        Trello has allowed me to keep track of my workload by breaking down larger jobs into smaller more manageable tasks. Where I can keep notes on them and share the Trello boards with others if needed.
        </p>
        <p>   
        Visual Studio Code is a software I am using to learn and test out different coding languages and get the syntax right. I have used it for Java Script and for HTML. This has allowed me to create a simple website.
        </p>
        <p>   
        Slack allows me to send messages instantly to those I am connected with on Slack. I can send messages to one person or create a group and send message to the whole group at once. This is quicker than writing and waiting for replies to emails.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="head">    
        <h2>Legal Guidelines and Constraints</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="post">
        <p>
        One legal this to be concerned about when running digital projects is data protection. Now know as GDPR, companies that hold personal data on the customers such as names, addresses, dates of birth and credit card numbers, and have a duty to keep this data safe and only access when needed. If data is lost, stolen or used when it is not needed, this can result in fines for business. So having effective data security is essential.
        </p>
        <p>   
        Another legal thing to consider is health and safety at work. While sitting down at a computer might not seem dangerous, it can cause injury. For example typing all day may create strains in peoples wrists, so as an employer you are obliged to provide your staff with ergonomic mice and keyboards. Staff should also be allowed regular breaks and looking at a computer screen for long periods of time can strain peoples eyes.

        <h2>Review the ongoing use of IT tools</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="post">
    <p>
    I am very satisfied with the tool I have used to create this website. Trello has allowed me to break down larger tasks into smaller more managable ones. Visual Studio Code has been very useful as it has allowed me to write my HTML and CCS code in the same software, which also allows me to easily make changes and see how to look on my website.        
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="head">
            <h2>Were the tools used appropriate</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="post">
    <p>
        Overall I feel the tools I used to create this website were entirely appropriate. Visual Studio Code is a coding software that has allowed me to write the HTML and CSS. Trello allowed me to manage all the steps I needed to take to complete the site. I also have used the browsers Google Chrome and Safari to check my website displays properly.
    </p>

    <div class="head">
        <h2>Strengths and weaknesses of the final project</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="post">
            <p>
                Some strengths of my website I believe are:
                <ol>
                    <li>It is simple, one page with easy headings to follow to find the required content</li>
                    <li>It is easy to look at, no crazy or clashing colours</li>
                    <li>It includes a picture that moves up and down as you scroll</li>
                    <li>The boxes change colour when you have the cursor over them, so you can see which box you're reading</li>
                </ol>
                <br />
                Some weaknesses of my website I believe are:
                <br />
                <br />
                <ol>
                    <li>It only has one page, so lots of scrolling is required</li>
                    <li>The image on the right hand side gets covered by the website review title</li>
                    <li>The use of dark colours can make it hard to read</li>
                    <li>There is an extra thick border where the title boxes and the content boxes meet</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            </div>
    <div class="head">
            <h2>Further possible improvements</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="post">
            <p>
                I would defiantly want to eliminate the lots of scrolling that is required, either by having each section on its own page. Or I could make it so that the boxes containing the contents are hidden and the titles are visible. So when you move the cursor over the title the content box appears underneath. I would also look to remove the double border that appears between the title and content boxes. Another improvement could be to make the image on the right hand side appear in front of the title box when scrolling.
            </p>
            </div>
    <div class="head">
            <h2>Review outcomes to make sure they match the requirements</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="post">
            <p>
                I believe I have met all the required criteria and my website is fit for purpose. I have created a website using HTML and CSS. I have researched and input my thoughts to the questioned posed on outcome 1.1 and have reviewed my website to show what could be improved in the future. 
            </p>

        <h2>Benefits and drawbacks of IT tools used in terms of efficiency</h2>
    </div>
<div class="post">
        <p>
            The tools used for my website were very suitable. With Visual Studio Code I was able to keep all the HTML and CSS in one place, where I could easily edit it. A down side too this was having to save and open the web page each time to check any changes made. A software that could show the changes live as they are made on a separate screen or tab would have saved time. I could have made greater use of Trello, by maybe adding a second board with small tasks related to building my website, including a card for each feature I wanted e.g. colour of boxes. This could have been done as a team to improve the efficiency, one person could have done the research, while another started on the HTML code. However as this was a small project getting a second person in might not have been a efficient use of resources.

<div class="head">
    <h2>Ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h2>
</div>       
<div class="post">
            <p>
                There are several ways productivity could be improved. Having different software that allowed for changes to be viewed in real time. Using Trello to set time scales on certain parts of the project. Working in a team, so by getting someone else to write the HTML and CCS code while I write the text/ content.
            </p>

<div class="head">
        <h2>Develop Solutions to improve own productivity in IT projects</h2>
    </div>
<div class="post">
            <p>
                Defiantly using a software where the code writing and changes can be view in real time, eliminating the need to keep saving the HTML file and refreshing a web browser. Another solution to improve my productivity would be working on a Windows PC, as this is what I am used to and I know many of the keyboard shortcuts. I would also have a mouse which I find easier to use than a laptop track pad. It is noted that a mouse can be plugged into to a laptop, even a mac.

    <h2>How to go about testing digital solutions</h2>
</div>
<div class="post">
            <p>
                One way would be to get in an external person to test it, though there is a cost associated with this. If I was part of a larger organisation there could be an in house development team with staff I could ask to test it. If I was testing it myself I could write a list of things to check and go through them one by one. Making comments where appropriate.

        <h2>Content and layout of each page</h2>
</div>
<div class="post">
        <p>
                My website is just one page, broken down into three sections each separated by a heading in a green bar that stretches across the width of the page. Under each main heading there are sub headings in a light green box, and under those sub headings is the content related to the heading above, this is the dark green box. All headings and content boxes will change colour if the cursor is moved over them. My website has a blue background and an imagine of the Pokemon squirtle on the right hand side that moves up and down as you scroll on the page.
        </p>
        </div>
<div class="head">
    <h2>Copyright and other constraints on websites</h2>
</div>
<div class="post">
        <p>
            Copyright is a key concern when creating a website, as you need permission to use certain images found online. You are able to buy stock images or you can get written consent from the image owner to use their image on your site, if you do this you will probably be required to give credit to the image owner. Another constraint affecting websites is that of many people using smartphones to view content. While PC screens are long and not tall, most smartphones are tall and not long. So a website needs to be able to be displayed in both versions. This is often called desktop view and mobile view. 
        </div>
<div class="head">
    <h2>Overcoming issues for disabled users</h2>
<div class="post">
    <p>
        One issue facing disabled users could be that of poor eyesight. This means that a website with small text would be difficult to read. This can be overcome by having websites with an option to display in large font, or switching between colour and black and white. Another factor could be users with limited use in their hands. This means they might not be able to click on lots of links or scroll easily. So having a website with minimal scrolling and pages could help these users. Users with hearing problems will not be effect by my website as there are no music or sounds.
